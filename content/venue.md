## Conference Outing: [Milwaukee River Roundup](https://www.mkeriverroundup.com/)
For the conference outing, we will be going on a kayak tour of the Milwaukee River for
the Milwaukee River Roundup.  The River Roundup will have food, drinks, and live
music as we paddle down the river.  Make sure you bring your sunscreen and good kayaking clothes!

The date is August 20 for Funkclub Wagon. Note that the tickets and the kayak
rental is non-refundable and it could be cancelled if the weather turns. So the
advice is the check the weather a few days before and if it looks good, go ahead
and buy it. Milwaukee weather forecasts are not reliable more than a few days
ahead.
