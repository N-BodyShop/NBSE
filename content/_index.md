Join us in August 2025 for the N-Body Shop Excellence Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. On August 18, we will host a hackathon and
for ChaNGa and gasoline users and developers, followed by a three-day conference on August 19-21. The conference will feature talks
from PIs, postdocs, and students in the N-Body Shop highlighting our work on star formation, galaxy evolution, cosmology and more.  Online participation will be available for those who cannot attend in person, with a link provided to those who register.

Conference sessions were streamed on zoom, and recordings can be found in the [Videos, Slides, \& Notes](videos/) page.
